# Archive Directory

This directory contains summaries of completed tasks.

When archiving a task:
1. Extract key learnings to `<task-name>.md`
2. Include: what was built, key decisions, gotchas discovered
3. Delete the original `devdocs/<task-name>/` directory

See `../README.md` for the full workflow.
